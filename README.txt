Though indirect illumination is one capability of photon mapping, I chose instead to focus on rendering caustics and more specifically, rendering lighting effects through transmitting surfaces. Another feature of photon mapping is that once the photons are mapped, the view camera can move and view the same scene, since the photons, though randomly distributed, do not move when the camera is moved. This view-independence feature was my primary motivation for exploring the possibility of view-independent non-photorealistic (NPR) rendering, since many methods of rendering artistic styles, stippling in particular, traditionally rely on generating random noise, which is difficult to keep consistent across multiple views.
